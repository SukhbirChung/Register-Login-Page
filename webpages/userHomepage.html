                <p>
                    Register/Login is a secure user authentication and authorization system that I 
                    built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, and Node.js with MongoDB 
                    for the backend. It enables users to register, log in, update their passwords, 
                    and delete their accounts, with all operations securely managed using the 
                    Passport npm package. This system showcases my ability to develop full-stack 
                    applications with a strong focus on security and user experience.
